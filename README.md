genetic_bitstrings
==================

This program was a mere exercise for getting the idea behind genetic
algorithms.

It's supposed to find the highest value bitstring starting with a random
population of bitstrings by using the idea of evolution which in this case
means figuring out which strings to breed new strings from for getting
the 1111111... string.
